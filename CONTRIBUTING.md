# Contributing

Found a bug or have an improvement? Awesome!

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-thing`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test them (seriously, test them)
5. Commit with a clear message
6. Push and open a PR

## Guidelines

- Write clear commit messages (not "fix stuff" or "updates")
- Add tests for new features
- Update docs if you change behavior
- Keep PRs focused (one thing at a time)

## Code Style

Follow the existing style. If there's a linter config, use it.
If not, just try to match what's already there.
